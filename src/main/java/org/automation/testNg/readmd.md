TestNG : TEST NEW GENERATION

Java based testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit.

TestNG is designed to cover a wider range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.

Advantages of TestNG:
1) Test cases & test suites
2) Grouping of test cases.
3) Prioritize
4) Parameterization
5) parallel testing
6) Reports

In TestNG, there will be no main method. Instead, we will have a testng.xml file which will contain the configuration of the test cases and test suites.
